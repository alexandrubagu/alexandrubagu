### Hi there 👋 I'm Alexandru
---
I'm a Software Developer born in Romania 🇷🇴 who is passionate about programming and building 🤔 smart, 🔨 maintainable and 💾 distributed applications. 

After spending 3+ years programming in ![Perl](https://img.shields.io/badge/perl-%2339457E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=perl&logoColor=white) and another 5+ years in ![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/php-%23777BB4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=php&logoColor=white) I was tired of [Object-Oriented Programming — The Trillion Dollar Disaster](https://betterprogramming.pub/object-oriented-programming-the-trillion-dollar-disaster-92a4b666c7c7)

so I've decided that is the 💸 perfect time to start learning something new. It's been +3 years since I've started to 🛠️ develop ![Elixir](https://img.shields.io/badge/elixir-%234B275F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=elixir&logoColor=white) applications using ![Phoenix](https://img.shields.io/badge/Phoenix-000000?style=for-the-badge&logo=Phoenix&logoColor=fff) ![Postgres](https://img.shields.io/badge/postgres-%23316192.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white) ![Redis](https://img.shields.io/badge/redis-%23DD0031.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=redis&logoColor=white) ![RabbitMQ](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rabbitmq-FF6600?style=for-the-badge&logo=rabbitmq&logoColor=white) On my daily basis I'm using ![Ubuntu](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ubuntu-E95420?style=for-the-badge&logo=ubuntu&logoColor=white) and I'm 🖋️ writing code in 
![Visual Studio](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio-5C2D91.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio&logoColor=white) but also I am proficient in ![Vim](https://img.shields.io/badge/VIM-%2311AB00.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vim&logoColor=white)


At some point, I used ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%2320232a.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=react&logoColor=%2361DAFB) ![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/redux-%23593d88.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=redux&logoColor=white) ![React Router](https://img.shields.io/badge/React_Router-CA4245?style=for-the-badge&logo=react-router&logoColor=white) for developing admin interfaces


In my ⏲️ spare time, I'm a newbie in 🎮 game development and currently I'm learning ![Blender](https://img.shields.io/badge/blender-%23F5792A.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=blender&logoColor=white) ![Threejs](https://img.shields.io/badge/threejs-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=three.js&logoColor=white) ![Godot Engine](https://img.shields.io/badge/GODOT-%23FFFFFF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=godot-engine)
